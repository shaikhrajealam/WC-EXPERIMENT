💻 Web Computing Experiments

A curated set of 10 practical web computing experiments designed to explore the fundamentals of web technologies, client–server communication, and interactive browser-based computation.



📘 Overview

This repository contains hands-on implementations that cover both foundational and advanced web concepts — from basic HTML pages to modern React and Node.js projects.
Each experiment is independent, focusing on one key concept to gradually build a strong understanding of web development and networking.


🧪 Experiments

Experiment 1: Basic HTML Webpage 📄

Folder: Exp1/exp1.html
Technologies Used: HTML5

Description:
A simple webpage for Anjuman-I-Islam’s Kalsekar Technical Campus demonstrating core HTML features — headings, lists, hyperlinks, tables, and a contact form layout.

Run Command:

open Exp1/exp1.html


Experiment 2: HTML with External CSS 🎨

Folder: Exp2/index.html, Exp2/styles.css
Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3

Description:
A creative design for Asad’s Book Haven showing the separation of structure (HTML) and style (CSS). Includes custom colors, typography, and layout management through external CSS.

Run Command:

open Exp2/index.html


Experiment 3: Responsive Design using Bootstrap 📱

Folder: Exp3/index.html
Technologies Used: HTML5, Bootstrap 5

Description:
A mobile-friendly book store built using Bootstrap components — featuring a navbar, hero banner, and responsive card grid optimized for various screen sizes.

Run Command:

open Exp3/index.html


Experiment 4: JavaScript Form Validation ✅

Folder: Exp4/index.html, Exp4/style.css
Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Description:
A registration page for AIKTC Engineering that includes real-time form validation using JavaScript. It validates user name, email, password strength, and mobile number before submission.

Run Command:

open Exp4/index.html



Experiment 5: React + TypeScript Form App ⚛️

Folder: Exp5/src/App.tsx, Exp5/package.json
Technologies Used: React, TypeScript, Vite

Description:
A modern form-based application built using React and TypeScript. Uses useState hooks for managing inputs and validation. Powered by Vite for faster builds and hot reload.

Run Commands:

cd Exp5
npm install
npm run dev
# App runs at http://localhost:5173



Experiment 6: Node.js Command-Line Calculator 🧮

Folder: Exp6/calculator.js
Technologies Used: Node.js

Description:
A command-line calculator built with Node.js that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations interactively through terminal input.

Run Commands:

cd Exp6
node calculator.js




Experiment 7: Network Setup Simulation 🌐

Folder: Exp7/Exp7.pkt
Technologies Used: Cisco Packet Tracer

Description:
A simulated network environment built in Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize basic device interconnections, IP configuration, and packet flow.

How to Open:
Open the .pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer:
File → Open → Exp7/Exp7.pkt

Experiment 8: Advanced Routing Simulation 🌐

Folder: Exp8/Exp8.pkt
Technologies Used: Cisco Packet Tracer

Description:
An extended version of the previous network setup that introduces routing protocols and dynamic IP configurations for better network management.

How to Open:
File → Open → Exp8/Exp8.pkt
